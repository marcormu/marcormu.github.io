    <p2> I made these profile pictures with a couple apps on my phone. </p2> 
    <br>
    <p3> I think I have been getting better at making these things because I have been doing for them for years.</p3>
    <br>
    <p1> All my friends told me to start using my laptop to edit stuff but I think it's more complicated there </p1>
    <br>
    <p2> I always make some for my friends and I feel like I can start a business making these. </p2>
