<p1>These are in fact part of my 20+ birds that my family has to deal with.</p1>
<br>
<p2> Yes, they are loud sometimes and won't stop chirping until they are covered with blankets.</p2>
<br>
<p1> If you want to know how or why I have these birds I will explain now </p1>
<br>
<p2> So this all started about a year ago when I only had like 5 parakeets. </p2>
<br>
<p1> Then one day one of them starting laying eggs and about a month later 6 babies hatched. </p1>
<br>
<p2> Well now you just repeat that step multiple times and here we are</p2>
<br>
<p1> Now we have more than 20 birds to buy food for and give water to.</p1>
