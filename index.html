  <h2> About Me! </h2>
  <img src="images/parakeets.jpg" alt = "birbs"/> 
  <br>
  <p1>I like to play a lot of video games even though it's bad for me.</p1>
<br>
  <p2> I also have a substantial amount of birds that all are parakeets. </p2>
<br>
  <p3> I think I spend too much time on youtube. </p3>
<br>
  <p2>I am from the Bronx but my parents are both Mexican.</p2>
    <br>
    <p1>What I enjoy doing is being lazy and talking with my friends and family.</p1>
    <br>
    <p2> I am currently attending the school, Bronx Early Academy for Teaching and Learning</p2>
    <br>
    <p1> I am able to speak spanish and english but english is my main language</p1>
    <br>
    <p2> I also like to do some graphic designing for things like Youtube. </p2>
